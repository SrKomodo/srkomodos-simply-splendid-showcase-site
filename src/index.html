          I'm a bored person on the internet that should be doing more important
          stuff like having a life but instead decides to spend his precious
          time programming stupid things that nobody will ever use ever.

        <p>
          Some time ago I was learning about boolean formulas and making really
          boring tables and diagrams about them. There was a website that did
          the formula for you but it displayed it in horrible ascii art, so I
          decided to make one myself!
        </p>
        <p>
          This website let's you input a formula, and it will calculate the
          table and render the circuit for it. You can change the table and the
          program will generate a formula that matches the table's results.

          This is a simple Firefox web extension that adds a cool little snake
          following your cursor. You can change the length of the snake, and
          choose from a list of skins to use. Also you can make the snake
          disappear when the mouse isn't moving so that it doesn't bother you.

          On January of 2018 Vsauce
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxRMyPsLtTk"
            >uploaded a video</a
          >
          about Genaille-Lucas rulers, a set of rulers that let you multiply
          numbers without actually doing the math.
        </p>
        <p>
          You see, the problem with this video is that it was uploaded on the
          DONG channel (which stands for Do Online Now Guys) and those rulers
          aren't really a DONG. So I made it into a DONG!
        </p>
        <p>
          The website let's you input two numbers, and the website will show you
          an animation of the rulers doing the calculation. It also works on
          mobile and let's you download it as an app. But the best thing about
          the website is that

          An epicycle is the movement of a point on a rotating circles. If you
          add rotating circles to those rotating circles you can get some pretty
          interesting patterns, so I made a website that randomly generates
          epicycles and let's you see how they spin around.

          Are you an avid consumer of internet media? Are you frustrated by the
          lack of a consistent way of getting notifications for the content that
          you love? If you answer yes to any of these questions, then RSS feeds
          are the solution for you!
        </p>
        <p>
          There is one problem i didn't mention...
        </p>
        <p>
          RSS feeds are an old technology straight from the 90s, and because of
          that most RSS readers and managers look like they are from the same
          era.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's why i made Easy RSS! The RSS manager for the common internet
          denizen! This stylish and modern RSS manager takes all the simplicity
          of the RSS format, and incorporates it into a modern and stylish
          design to create an easy to use but still powerful piece of software.
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay lets cut the elevator pitch bullcrap, this is a shitty extension
          that I made because I don't trust youtube's subscription
          notifications.

          I was bored of having to find shitty online tetris clones while at
