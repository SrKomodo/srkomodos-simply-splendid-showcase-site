      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>

      <h1>Who even are you?</h1>
      <p>
        I'm nobody important, I just enjoy doing this kind of stuff so I publish it to the
        <em>internet tubes</em> just in case somebody else that also enjoys doing that stuff wants to see the stuff that I did.

      <h1>Why Is this layout so weird?</h1>
      <p>
        I was just watching Jen Simmons on youtube and wanted to do something cool with CSS Grid. Also my old showcase site was way
        too average and i wanted to be
        <em>ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣ</em>.

      <h1>
        Mouse Pet
        <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/mouse-pet/">(link)</a>
        <a href="https://github.com/SrKomodo/mouse-pet">(code)</a>
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a simple Firefox webextension that adds a cool little snake following your cursor. You can change the length of the
        snake, and choose from a list of skins to use. Also you can make the snake disappear when the mouse isn't moving
        so that it doesn't bother you.

        Lucas's Rulers

      <p>
        On January of 2018 Vsauce
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxRMyPsLtTk">uploaded a video</a> about Genaille-Lucas rulers, a set of rulers that let you multiply numbers without actually
        doing the math.
      </p>
      <p>
        You see, the problem with this video is that it was uploaded on the DONG channel (which stands for Do Online Now Guys) and
        those rulers aren't really a DONG. So I made it into a DONG!
      </p>
      <p>
        The website let's you input two numbers, and the website will show you an animation of the rulers doing the calculation.
        It also works on mobile and let's you download it as an app. But the best thing about the website is that
        <a href="https://twitter.com/tweetsauce/status/952745273733754880">the Sauce himself</a> liked it.

      <p>
        I really like ARGs and mystery solving (if you like that kind of stuff check out Gravity Falls it's an amazing show) so I
        decided to make a website to easily decrypt text with various common ciphers.

        Meme.go
        <a href="https://github.com/SrKomodo/meme">(code)</a>
      </h1>
      <p>
        I made a meme renderer and templating engine in Golang. It is probably the worst thing i have ever published to the internet.
        The worst thing is that it has really good documentation.

        Epicycler

      </h1>
      <p>
        An epicycle is the movement of a point on a rotating circles. If you add rotating circles to those rotating circles you can
        get some pretty interesting patterns, so I made a website that randomly generates epicycles and let's you see how
        they spin around.
