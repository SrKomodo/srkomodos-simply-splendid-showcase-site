      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm SrKomodo, and welcome to
        <em>SrKomodo's Simply Splendid Showcase Site!</em> Here you can find all of my weird projects and general abominations
        that i want the world to see!

      <h1>Who even are you?</h1>
      <p>
        I'm nobody important, I just enjoy doing this kind of stuff so I publish it to the internet tubes just in case somebody else
        that also enjoys doing that stuff wants to see the stuff that I did.

      <h1>Why Is this layout so weird?</h1>
      <p>
        I was just watching Jen Simmons on youtube and wanted to do something cool with CSS Grid. Also my old showcase site was way
        too average and i wanted to be
        <em>ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣ</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want a more normal layout just input the konami code.

        Boolean Formula Solver

      </h1>
      <p>
        Some time ago i was learning about boolean formulas and making really boring tables and diagrams about them. There was a
        website that did the formula for you but it displayed it in horrible ascii art, so I decided to make one myself!
      </p>
      <p>
        This website let's you input a formula, and it will calculate the table and render the circuit for it. You can also input
        a table and the program will generate a formula that matches the table's results.

        Mouse Pet

      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a simple Firefox webextension that adds a cool little snake following your cursor. You can change the length of the
        snake, and choose from a list of skins to use. Also you can make the snake disappear when the mouse isn't moving
        so that it doesn't bother you.

        Lucas's Rulers
        <a href="https://srkomodo.github.io/lucas-rulers/">(link)</a>
        <a href="https://github.com/SrKomodo/lucas-rulers">(code)</a>
      </h1>
      <p>
        On January of 2018 Vsauce
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxRMyPsLtTk">uploaded a video</a> about Genaille-Lucas rulers, a set of rulers that let you multiply numbers without actually
        doing the math.
      </p>
      <p>
        You see, the problem with this video is that it was uploaded on the DONG channel (which stands for Do Online Now Guys) and
        those rulers aren't really a DONG. So I made it into a DONG!
      </p>
      <p>
        The website let's you input two numbers, and the website will show you an animation of the rulers doing the calculation.
        It also works on mobile and let's you download it as an app. But the best thing about the website is that
        <a href="https://twitter.com/tweetsauce/status/952745273733754880">the Sauce himself</a> liked it.

      </h1>
      <p>
        I really like ARGs and mystery solving (if you like that kind of stuff check out Gravity Falls it's an amazing show) so I
        decided to make a website to easily decrypt text with various common ciphers.

        Epicycler

        <a href="https://github.com/SrKomodo/epicycler">(code)</a>
      </h1>
      <p>
        An epicycle is the movement of a point on a rotating circles. If you add rotating circles to those rotating circles you can
        get some pretty interesting patterns, so I made a website that randomly generates epicycles and let's you see how
        they spin around.

        Yet Another Procastination Blocker
        <a href="https://github.com/SrKomodo/yapb">(link)</a>
      </h1>
      <p>
        Most procastination blockers are simply browser extensions that block certain websites at certain times. The problem with
        this is that i can just open up the website on another browser and evade the blocker, also it would be cool if we
        could also block certain programs from running.
      </p>
      <p>
        YAPB (Yet Another Procastination Blocker) fixes both of these problems, by blocking websites globally by editing the hostfile
        on your computer. Also it stops programs from running.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course this would work if the program was actually finished. I haven't worked on this project in like a year, and if I
        ever decide to finish it I'll probably just delete the existing code and start all over again.
